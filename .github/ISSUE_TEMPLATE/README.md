# Issue Templates for Teachers

This directory contains GitHub issue templates designed to make it easy for teachers to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities system.

## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do This:
- **Be specific**: Instead of "fix colors", say "change blue background to school colors: white (#FFFFFF) and lime green (#32CD32)"
- **Include examples**: Reference other websites, provide links, attach screenshots
- **Think about users**: Consider how students, other teachers, and parents will be affected
- **Set realistic priorities**: Not everything needs to be "Critical"

### ‚ùå Avoid This:
- Vague requests like "make it better" or "fix the website"
- Technical jargon - use plain language instead
- Multiple unrelated requests in one issue
- Skipping required fields

1. **You submit** the issue using one of these templates
2. **Development team reviews** and may ask clarifying questions
3. **Copilot coding agent** gets assigned to implement your request
4. **You review** the completed work and provide feedback
